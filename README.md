# Emulating Double-Precision Floating-Point Matrix Multiplication Using Half-Precision Floating-Point Numbers

**Marc Matter, Max Striebel, Michael MÃ¶rschell, Michael Siebenmann, Tynan Richards**

> This is a course project for ETH's Design of Parallel and High-Performance Computing (DPHPC) course. We implement fp64 matrix multiplication using fp16 and fp32 tensor cores.

## Usage
The build system is currently configured to operate on Unix machines.

To **build** use the command: `make build`

To **run** use the command: `make run` (by default this will validate the correctness of all implementation versions specified in the main function of main.c)

To **generate** performance and speedup **plots** use the command: `make plot`
